Whitespace Total Fixer
======================

Identifies and/or fixes inconsistent whitespace and line endings in
text files, so that they don't clog up your commits to version control
systems like Git, Mercurial, or Subversion.

How to use it ([see below](#options) for options to control exactly which
whitespace issues it fixes):

```bash
# consistent whitespace from programs that generate text files
dump_database_schema | wtf.py -o clean_output.sql

# in-place editing
wtf.py -i file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
wtf.py -I.bak file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt # ditto, with backups

# summarize a bunch of files without actually editing them (-0)
find . -name "*.txt" -exec wtf.py -0 {} \;

# more advanced: find interesting text files. pass options and a directory
wtf-find() {
    find "${@: -1}" -not \( -name .svn -prune -o -name .git -prune \
         -o -name .hg -prune \) -type f -exec bash -c \
         'grep -Il "" "$1" &>/dev/null && wtf.py '"${*:1:$#-1}"' "$1"' _ {} \;
}
wtf-find -0 .

# exit status
wtf.py file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt > /dev/null
if (( $? == 10 )); then
  echo "issues fixed"
elif (( $? == 20 )); then
  echo "unfixed issues!"
fi
```

Why you should use it:

* It's like an incomprehensible shell-script one-liner (e.g. `sed -e 's/LINENOISE/'`), but way better
* It's similar to [`git
  stripspace`](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-stripspace.html),
  but more flexible and detailed.
* `wtf.py` is a simple Python2 script (tested with 2.7.5) with *no
  dependencies beyond the standard Python library*.

Exciting origin story
---------------------

One day at work, I spent way too much time wrangling commits
laden with whitespace issues generated by recalcitrant text-editing
tools on multiple platforms.

That evening, I went home and spent way too much time writing this
program instead!

<a name="options"/>Whitespace issues addressed
----------------------------------------------

WTF currently fixes, or simply reports, a few common types of whitespace
issues. Most of these issues offer three possible command-line options
enabling the user to fix, report, or ignore the issue.

* Remove trailing spaces at the ends of lines (default is **fix**):

        -t, --trail-space
        -T, --report-trail-space
        -It, --ignore-trail-space

* Remove blank lines at the ends of files (default is **fix**):

        -b, --eof-blanks
        -B, --report-eof-blanks
        -Ib, --ignore-eof-blanks

* Ensure that a new-line character appears at the end of the file (default is **fix**):

        -n, --eof-newl
        -N, --report-eof-newl
        -In, --ignore-eof-newl

* Make sure that all lines have matching EOL markers (that is, no
  mixing of lf/crlf). Default is to **fix** non-matching EOL
  characters by making them all the same as the first line of the
  file. The desired EOL markers can also be set to a specific value
  (lf/crlf/native), in which case all lines will unconditionally
  receive this marker. Additionally `--expect-eol` can be used to
  report line endings not matching the value set (lf/crlf/native).

        -m, --match-eol
        -M, --report-match-eol
        -Im, --ignore-match-eol
        -E ENDING, --coerce-eol ENDING
        --expect-eol ENDING

* Check for spaces followed by tabs in the whitespace at the beginning
  of a line; fixing this condition requires setting either
  `--change-tabs` or `--change-spaces`. The default is to report and
  **warn**:

        -s, --tab-space-mix
        -S, --report-tab-space-mix
        -Is, --ignore-tab-space-mix

* Change tabs in the whitespace at the beginning of a line to the
  specified number of spaces (default is not to change tabs at
  all). This option will *not* touch leading tabs when they are mixed
  with spaces, *unless* `--tab-space-mix` is also specified.

        -x SPACES, --change-tabs SPACES

* Change the specified number of consecutive spaces in the whitespace
  at the beginning of a line to tabs (default is not to change spaces
  at all). This option will *not* touch leading tabs when they are mixed
  with spaces, *unless* `--tab-space-mix` is also specified.

        -y SPACES, --change-spaces SPACES

Reporting
---------

Unless the `-q`/`--quiet` option is used, WTF will summarize each file
processed in which any whitespace issues were found and/or fixed. With
`-v` it will also report issue-free files.

    $ wtf -0 nightmare.txt    # -0 is equivalent to > /dev/null
    nightmare.txt LINE 8: WARNING: spaces followed by tabs in whitespace at beginning of line
    nightmare.txt:
        CHOPPED 1 lines with trailing space
        CHOPPED 0 blank lines at EOF
        ADDED newline at EOF
        CHANGED 1 line endings which didn't match crlf from first line
        WARNED ABOUT 1 lines with tabs/spaces mix

WTF will return the following exit codes on successful operation:

* `0`: no issues seen (or `-X`/`--no-exit-codes` specified)
* `10`: issues fixed
* `20`: unfixed issues seen
